    <h2>Hello there! 🤓</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Anton and I'm Software Engineer with over 10 years of
      experience ("Hello, Anton" proceeded with sad applause 👏🏻)
    </p>
    <p>
      My main skill is mobile development: mostly native iOS, but I have
      experience with React Native and Xamarin as well. I participate in all
      stages of application development process from discussing requirements
      with customer to submitting into store.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, I’m not just mobile developer: I have pretty solid technical
      background in computer science and I’m very interested in designing
      complex systems, functional programming and generally in programming.
      Currently, I invest a lot of time into web development (frontend mostly)
      and, I'm not gonna lie, I'm impressed by the quality of tooling and
      satisfaction I'm getting from development. I hope, that this blog will
      help me to structurize my own thoughts about different topics.
